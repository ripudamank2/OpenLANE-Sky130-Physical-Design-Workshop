# OpenLANE-Sky130-Physical-Design-Workshop
Physical design is the process of turning a design into fabricable geometries. It comprises a number of steps, including floorplanning, placement, clock tree synthesis, and routing. 
  1. Physical design begins with a netlist, which is synthesized from RTL. The netlist describes the components of a circuit and there connection.
  2. Floorplanning is the big step which involves identifying which IPs or circuits should be placed near others, taking into account area restrictions, speed, and                 the various constraints required by IPs.
  3. Placement determines the locations of each component on the chip or die , considering timing and interconnect length. 
  4. Clock tree synthesis involves inserting buffers or inverters such that the clock is distributed evenly in a design, minimizing skew and delay. 

The final output of the physical design process is typically GDSII.

 **OpenLANE** is a an Architecture which consist of different tool which help an IC DESIGNER to covert RTL code to GDSII/LEF. In our lab we have use the OpenLane in an interactive way as shown below .
  **1.Synthesis**
  
        a. yosys - Performs RTL synthesis
        b. abc - Performs technology mapping
        c. OpenSTA - Pefroms static timing analysis on the resulting netlist to generate timing reports
 
 **2.Floorplan and PDN**
 
        a. init_fp - Defines the core area for the macro as well as the rows (used for placement) and the tracks (used for routing)
        b. ioplacer - Places the macro input and output ports
        c. pdn - Generates the power distribution network
        d. tapcell - Inserts welltap and decap cells in the floorplan

  **3.Placement**

         a. RePLace - Performs global placement
         b. Resizer - Performs optional optimizations on the design
         c. OpenPhySyn - Performs timing optimizations on the design
         d. OpenDP - Perfroms detailed placement to legalize the globally placed components
  
  **4.CTS**
  
         a.TritonCTS - Synthesizes the clock distribution network (the clock tree)
  **5.Routing**

         a.FastRoute - Performs global routing to generate a guide file for the detailed router
         b.TritonRoute - Performs detailed routing
         c.SPEF-Extractor - Performs SPEF extraction
  **6.GDSII Generation**
        
        a.Magic - Streams out the final GDSII layout file from the routed def

**Below picture show the flow of OpenLane :**

  In this LAB1 we had to synthesis a design picorv32a by using OpenLANE -interactive mode.
  If your using the lab session from https://www.vlsisystemdesign.com/ then you dont need to configure Docker but if your using in your PC you need to configure docker.
  So i didnt use my PC for this practical session , so i just need to open flow.tcl file in intercative mode . Its script which will invoke the Openlane. 
  
            ./flow.tcl -interactive
  
  Include the package by using the below command

             package require openlane 0.9
             
  After that you need to prepare your design files "picorv32a" with below command

             prep -design ./designs/picorv32a
             
  When the design is prepared run syntheis by using below command

              run_synthesis
          
  Finally we need check the total area occupied by picorv32a in form of flipflops, adders, AND, OR gates etc. :
